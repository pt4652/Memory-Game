## Development

The project was based on starter code from Udacity - index.html, app.js, app.cs as well as image files and other code that were not updated.  The index.html code was updated in 4 places (see commented sections in that file), app.cs was updated by adding one section at the end (also commented).  The majority of the work was in app.js and is commented throughout.

## Instructions for the GAME

From the home directory launch index.html.  There are 16 cards, clicking on a card turns the card over to show its' 'icon' face; click on a second care to reveal its face as well.  Each card has a matching twin; if the two cards match they lock in the open position and you move on to the next pair; if they do not match they flip back over to show the default face.  The goal of the game is to match all eigth pairs in the shortest time.
